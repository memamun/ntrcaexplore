Interviews reward candidates who stay calm and concise. This plan helps you control the controllables and arrive with confidence.

## One week before

- Print your acknowledgement slip, academic certificates, and an updated resume.
- Call the venue to confirm room numbers and reporting time; update your map with the exact gate.
- Prepare a 60-second introduction that covers education, current role, and subject strengths.

## The night before

- Pack originals and photocopies in a clear folder arranged by importance.
- Set out formal attire that matches the current dress code.
- Sleep early—your brain needs the rest more than another hour of note-taking.

## On the day

- Arrive 45–60 minutes early to account for security checks.
- Keep your phone silent; carry a printed copy of any email instructions.
- When answering, lead with the result or decision, then explain your reasoning briefly.

## After the interview

Note any unexpected questions or instructions while they are fresh. This helps teammates and future you refine prep materials for the next round.
