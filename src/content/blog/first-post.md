Staying organized is half the battle when the NTRCA window opens. Use this quick checklist to reduce last-minute rushes and avoid repeated logins.

## 1. Confirm your profile details

Make sure your name, date of birth, and NID match across your previous applications, certificates, and any coaching registrations. Keep a scanned copy of each in a single folder labeled with the current year.

## 2. Prepare files in the right format

- **Photo**: 300x300 JPG, under 100KB.
- **Signature**: 300x80 JPG, under 60KB.
- **Certificates**: Merge PDFs by level (SSC, HSC, Honours, Masters) and keep each under 1.5MB.

## 3. Collect payment details

Note the exact fee for your subject, have a bKash/Nagad number ready, and keep a screenshot of the transaction ID. Add it to the same folder as your certificates.

## 4. Submit during low-traffic hours

Aim for early morning or late evening to avoid server timeouts. If you hit an error, wait ten minutes before retrying instead of refreshing repeatedly.

## 5. Save your proof

Download and print the acknowledgement slip immediately. Save a PDF copy in your NTRCA folder and email it to yourself so you can retrieve it from any device.

Stay calm, follow the list, and you will breeze through the form without a second attempt.
