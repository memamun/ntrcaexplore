The newest NTRCA circular is short but important. Before you rush to apply, review these highlights and adjust your plan accordingly.

### Dates worth pinning

- **Application window:** 1 June – 15 June 2024 (closes at 11:59 PM).
- **Payment deadline:** Same window; transactions after the cutoff will be rejected.
- **Correction window:** 17–19 June 2024 for minor typos and replacing uploads.

### Eligibility adjustments

1. **Age calculation** is now tied to 30 May 2024. If you turned 35 after that date, you can still apply.
2. **Honours final year** candidates must upload a provisional certificate issued in 2024.
3. **Subject mapping** has been simplified—Business Management now falls under the Commerce track.

### Document reminders

- Keep your last acknowledgement slip handy; the application portal may prompt for the previous roll number.
- Use the same phone number and email address as your prior submission to avoid OTP delays.
- If you change your photo, make sure the background color matches the current instruction (white this cycle).

### How to use this info

Update your personal checklist, adjust your document set, and schedule a payment slot before the third day of the window. Share this post with colleagues so they can avoid rework too.
